# data-visualize-hub

Write the code for an advanced interactive data visualization dashboard using React.js. The dashboard should serve as a control center for monitoring and analyzing various data points through real-time charts and graphs. Implement real-time data updates using WebSockets to ensure that visualizations, including line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps, update automatically. Use libraries like D3.js and Chart.js for creating interactive and visually appealing visualizations.
